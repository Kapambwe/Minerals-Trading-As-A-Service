Delivery Is Done via a Warrant

A warrant is a digital certificate that proves ownership of a specific quantity of metal stored in an LME-approved warehouse.

When delivery is made, the seller transfers the warrant to the buyer.

So, the buyer receives ownership of metal stored in a warehouse, not the metal itself (yet).
