Delivery or Cash Settlement

At contract expiry, one of two things happens:

✅ Physical Delivery:

The seller delivers the metal (stored in LME-approved warehouses around the world).

The buyer pays.

✅ Cash Settlement:

If both sides agree, they settle the price difference in cash instead of exchanging metal.
