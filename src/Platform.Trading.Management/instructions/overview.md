A trade is made:

A buyer and seller agree to trade copper on the ZME (Zambia Metal Exchange).

This could be for immediate delivery or a future date.

The clearing house steps in:

ZME's clearing house is called ZME Clear.

Once the trade is confirmed, ZME Clear becomes the middleman:

It becomes the buyer to the seller, and the seller to the buyer.

This is called "novation."

Why use a clearing house?

It guarantees the trade even if one party fails.

It reduces counterparty risk—the risk that one side won't pay or deliver.

Daily margin checks:

ZME Clear collects money from both parties called "margin".

This is like a security deposit to protect against losses.

Each day, they check whether prices have changed.

If the copper price moves against you, you may need to pay more margin (called variation margin).

Settlement and delivery:

On the day the contract ends (called maturity), ZME Clear ensures:

The seller delivers the copper (if it's a physical contract).

The buyer pays.

If it's cash-settled, ZME Clear just handles the money transfer based on price changes.
